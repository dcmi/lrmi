# Learning Resource Metadata Initiative Development & Guidance

The [LRMI specification](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi/) is a collection of classes, properties and concept schemes for markup and description of educational resources. This vocabulary is designed to be used alongside other resource description vocabularies such as those provided by DCMI, [Schema.org](https://schema.org) and other standards. A significant part of the LRMI specification is mirrored under the [schema.org/LearningResource](https://schema.org/LearningResource) class.

This repository provides in-development and informative resources about [LRMI](https://www.dublincore.org/about/lrmi/), including:
* [LRMI Terms](lrmi_terms/): development versions of RDF definitions of LRMI Terms in Turtle;
* [LRMI Vocabs](lrmi_vocabs): development versions of RDF definitions of concept schemes relevant to LRMI terms;
* [LRMI Examples](lrmi_examples): high level examples of LRMI.

For the stable, normative versions of the terms and concept schemes, see [LRMI Specifications](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/lrmi/) on the DCMI website.
